        <p>The Bauhaus was a German art school operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and the fine arts. It played a pivotal role in the development of modern architecture and design, emphasizing functionality, simplicity, and the integration of art into everyday life.</p>

      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>Founded in 1919 in Weimar, Germany, by architect Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus aimed to bridge the gap between art and industry. It relocated to Dessau in 1925 and then to Berlin in 1932 before being closed by the Nazis in 1933 due to its progressive ideals.</p>
