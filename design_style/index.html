      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>While cartooning dates back centuries, cartoon web design emerged in the early 2000s as designers began incorporating animated GIFs and illustrated characters onto websites. The rise of platforms like Newgrounds, DeviantArt, and later the popularity of motion design and character-driven branding transformed cartoon aesthetics into a legitimate web design movement. Today, with improved browsers and CSS animation capabilities, cartoon design has become a powerful tool for creating immersive, personality-driven digital experiences.</p>

        <div>
          <h4>Character-Driven Design</h4>
          <p>Creating memorable mascots and characters that represent the brand. These characters guide users through the experience, making interactions feel more personal and engaging rather than transactional.</p>

          <p>Animations and transitions that feel alive and responsive. Bouncing, morphing, and exaggerated movements add personality and make user interactions feel rewarding and delightful.</p>
